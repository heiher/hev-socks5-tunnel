#chnroutes:
  # Enables split routing based on a list of Chinese IP ranges.
  # When enabled, traffic to IPs within the specified file will be considered "domestic".
  # This allows for different routing decisions, e.g., domestic traffic can be connected
  # directly, while other traffic goes through the SOCKS5 proxy.
  # The feature is enabled if this file path is set.
# file-path: "conf/chnroutes.txt"

#smart-proxy:
  # Enables a "smart" fallback mechanism for non-domestic TCP traffic.
  # When a TCP connection to a non-domestic IP is attempted:
  # 1. It first tries to connect directly.
  # 2. If the direct connection attempt times out (takes longer than `timeout-ms`),
  #    it will then fall back to using the SOCKS5 proxy for that connection.
  # 3. The IP address that timed out is temporarily "blocked" for a duration of
  #    `blocked-ip-expiry-minutes`.
  # 4. Future connection attempts to a blocked IP will skip the direct attempt and
  #    go straight to the SOCKS5 proxy, improving performance for slow-to-reach sites.
  #
  # Feature is enabled if both timeout-ms and blocked-ip-expiry-minutes are set and non-zero.

  # Timeout in milliseconds for direct connection attempts.
# timeout-ms: 2000
  # Expiry time in minutes for temporarily blocked IPs.
# blocked-ip-expiry-minutes: 360
